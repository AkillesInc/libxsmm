# Image Convolution

This code sample aims to provide a simple piece of code, which takes an image and produces a visual result as well. The implementation uses LIBXSMM's DNN-domain. This code sample is not superceeding the collection of [DNN code samples](https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm/tree/master/samples/dnn)!

The executable can run in the following way:

> iconv   [\<filename-in\>  [\<filename-out\>  [\<kh\>  [\<kw\>]]]]

Above, `kh` and `kw` specify the kernel size of the convolution.
